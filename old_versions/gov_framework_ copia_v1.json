Example: The <a href='https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo' target='_blank'>Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO)</a> ontology is hosted and maintained on <a href='https://github.com/' target='_blank'>GitHub</a>.\n- <strong>Institutional servers</strong>: Commonly used when ontologies are developed and maintained internally by organizations or research projects with specific infrastructure needs. This option is more recommended if you want to focus more on the project that gives context to the ontologies. Example: The <a href='https://bimerr.iot.linkeddata.es/' target='_blank'>BIMERR</a> ontology network is hosted within a dedicated project infrastructure.\n- <strong>Ontology repositories and portals</strong>: Some ontology repositories not only serve as publication platforms but also support hosting.

Configure the hosting server (commonly Apache) to handle HTTP Accept headers:\n- Requests with Accept: text/html → redirect to HTML documentation\n- Requests with Accept: application/rdf+xml or text/turtle → return the corresponding RDF serialization.\n\nThis is often implemented using 303 See Other HTTP redirects.

To do so, here are some recommedations:\n\n<strong>1. Use well-known annotations properties</strong>. There are three main properties that are highly used to defined terms:\n\n- From RDF Schema the annotation <a href='http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label' target='_blank'>rdfs:label</a> or from SKOS <a href='http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel' target='_blank'>skos:prefLabel</a> to indicate the human-readable version of the name of the term. Sometimes the label of the term can be different from its identifier (see more information in Principle 5 - Identifiers).  There are some cases in which the authors prefer to create their own property to label their terms. In this case, it is recommended to connect your labeling property to rdfs:label explicitly with the rdfs:subPropertyOf property.\n\n- From SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) the property <a href='http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#definition' target='_blank'>skos:definition</a> to add the formal definition of the term.\n\n- From RDF Schema the annotation property <a href='http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment' target='_blank'>rdfs:comment</a> to add the formal definition of the term or other type of additional information.\n\nIn fact, both rdfs:comment and skos:definition can be used at the same time. In this case, normally skos:definition is used to add the formal definition of the term, and rdfs:comment is used to add additional information, e.g. an example where the term can be used. \n\n<strong>2. Reuse well-known sources.</strong>\n\nIf applicable, it is recommended to use already existing definitions from standard references for the definition such as terminologies, dictionaries, glossaries, ISO standards, etc. When applying this process, the original source should be indicated using the annotation from RDF Schema <a href='http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#isDefinedby' target='_blank'>rdfs:isDefinedBy</a>.\n\n** Note: For the annotation isDefinedBy it is recommended to add the link to the specific version of the ontology or vocabulary source. \n\n<strong>3. Clear, natural and simple text.</strong>\n\nLast but not least, it is important that the definition is well-written in natural language that is understood by domain experts and ontology users. The term's definition should be defined as simply and accurately as possible, trying to avoid circularity (using the term itself in the definition). \n\nExample of documenting a term called \"Protein\":\n\n<pre>\n@prefix owl: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#&gt; .\n@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .\n@prefix rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt; .\n@prefix skos: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#&gt; .\n@prefix ex: &lt;https://w3id.org/example&gt; .\n\nex:Protein rdf:type owl:Class ;\n    rdfs:label \"Protein\"@en ;\n    skos:definition \"Linear POLYPEPTIDES that are synthesized on RIBOSOMES and may be further modified, crosslinked, cleaved, or assembled into complex proteins with several subunits.\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"Proteins play a central role in biological processes such as enzymatic catalysis, DNA replication, and cellular signaling.\"@en ;\n    rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D011506&gt; .\n</pre>"

As the ontology, the documentation is also a evolving resource that reflects the changes, decisions, and developments in the ontology over time. Here are some best practives to generate human-readable documentation:\n\n1. Documentation is an iterative process\n\nDocumentation must accompany the ontology through all its phases (requirements specification, implementation, publication, maintenance, etc). Any change to the ontology (e.g., adding or deprecating elements) should be reflected in the corresponding documentation. This is important not only for the future users, but also for the authors themselves.\n\n2. Choose an appropriate format for documenting and publishing the ontology:\n\nIt is important to document each element of the ontology in a human-readable way since it is not always easy to go through the Turtle or RDF/XML file and understand searching and trying to understand the terms. The most recommended practice is to public the documentation of the ontology in an interactive HTML page (see example http://bimerr.iot.linkeddata.es/def/sensor-data). Although this can be as a difficult way, in fact there are several tools created by the Semantic Web Community that allows to create this pages from the metadata and annotation properties of the ontology:\n\n+ WIDOCO: Generates comprehensive HTML documentation from ontology metadata and annotations.\n\n+ LODE: Lightweight and quick HTML renderer for OWL ontologies.\n\n+ ProtégéOWLDoc: plugin of Protégé that allows to export to HTML\n\n+ Ontoology: Web-based platform that supports validation, documentation, and publication via <a href='https://github.com/' target='_blank'>GitHub</a>.\n\nHowever there are also other options for publishing the ontology documentation. For example in static documents, such as PDFs or Word files. It is a more conservative and easy to manage option, but it is also a really time-consuming task.\n\n3. Cite the ontology in a formal and persistent way\n\nIf the ontology has been published in a scientific article or as part of a project deliverable, it is recommended to include a proper citation of the resource in the documentation. However, if there is no paper describing the ontology, it is still recommended to add in the metadata of the ontology and in its documentation an indication on how to cite the resource."

It represents the ontology as a whole and should remain stable over time to support long-term discoverability and reuse. The following best practices can guide the design and management of the IRI:\n\n1. Choose a reliable and persistent domain\n\nTo ensure the ontology remains accessible in the long term, it is recommended to register it under a persistent IRI service rather than a personal, project-specific, or institutional domain that might expire or change. In the community there are two wel-known services that allows to obtain a persisten IRI freely:\n\n- w3id.org: A W3C community-driven initiative that allows users to register persistent identifiers that redirect to a controlled destination. You can manage redirections via a <a href='https://github.com/' target='_blank'>GitHub</a> repository.\n\n- purl.org: Maintained by the Internet Archive, PURL provides a similar service, letting you define stable URLs that can redirect to new destinations if needed.\n\nThese services allow ontology maintainers to separate the ontology's identifier from its physical location, so if the ontology files are ever moved or restructured, the IRI remains unchanged by simply updating the redirection rules.\n\n1. Avoid unstable or project-specific naming\n\nAlthough it is common to see ontology IRIs hosted under institutional or project domains, this should be done only when the domain is expected to be actively maintained for the long term. Avoid including names of short-lived projects or organizational acronyms unless they represent long-term initiatives.\n\n3. Define a meaningful and stable path structure\n\nConstruct the ontology IRI path so that it is:\n\n- Readable (e.g., https://w3id.org/urban-energy rather than https://w3id.org/ue2022)\n\n- Free of version numbers: Version-specific IRIs should be handled separately (see G5.2.1 - Versioning). The main IRI should always point to the latest version.\n\n- Independent of implementation format: Avoid including file extensions (e.g., .rdf, .owl) or system-specific folders.\n\n4. Support dereferencing and content negotiation\n\nThe ontology IRI should resolve via HTTP and support content negotiation, which allows users and systems to retrieve either:\n\n- A human-readable HTML documentation page\n\n- A machine-readable serialization (e.g., RDF/XML, Turtle)\n\n(see Principle 1 - Availability, G1.1.1 for more information on content negotiation)\n\n5. Design of the name and prefix of the ontology:\n\nIt is recommendable to use short names or acronyms to facilitate the findability of your ontology. The prefix should be in line with this name. It is important as mentioned in Principe 2 - Scope, to check if there are alreaedy existing ontologies with the same prefix in the platform prefix.cc, \n\nOnce your ontology IRI,  and its preferred prefix are defined, it is a good practice to define the prefix in https://prefix.cc/, a public registry of commly namespaces and their prefixes. It allows users to look up or register short, ontology namespace prefixes and their corresponding namespace IRIs."

The fragment of text after \"#\" identifies the term. This strategie is best for small to medium ontologies. It requires a simpler hosting and single-page HTML documentation.\n\nB) Slash-based IRIs (e.g., https://w3id.org/biodiv-onto/Species)\n\nHere each term is treated as a resolvable resource.

The base ontology IRI (e.g., https://w3id.org/example) should always resolve to the latest version.\n\nThe version IRI (e.g., https://w3id.org/example/1.2.0) points to a specific release and remains immutable. This separation ensures backward compatibility and avoids breaking references in reused data.\n\nHowever,  embedding version numbers in term IRIs (e.g., https://w3id.org/example/1.2.0#Organization) is discouraged because it forces consumers to update instance data when the ontology evolves. Instead, use versioning only at the ontology IRI level (with owl:versionIRI) while keeping the namespace consistent.\n\nFinally, it is important to declare version metadata in the ontology file:\n\n- owl:versionIRI: the IRI of the current version of the ontology.\n\n- owl:versionInfo: a human-readable string describing the version (e.g., \"Version 1.2.0 - Minor update\").\n\n- owl:previousIRI: link to the previous version helps to see how the ontology has changed."

It helps both ontology developers and users understand, reference, and work with terms efficiently. When defining a naming convention for classes, properties, and individuals, consider the following aspects:\n\n1. Choose between opaque and natural language identifiers\n\na) Opaque identifiers use abstract, language-independent codes (e.g., EXO_C0001) instead of human-readable names (ExampleClassA). The advantages are that the identifier remains stable even if the label changes and that it promotes language neutrality and avoids encoding issues. However it requires additional tooling to resolve identifiers to human-readable labels and it is less intuitive for developers and users inspecting the ontology directly. This approach is commonly used in large biomedical ontologies (e.g., OBO Foundry).\n\nb) Natural language identifiers embed descriptive names into the IRI (e.g., Person, hasAddress). They are easier to read and interpret by humans. But changing a concept name may require changing the IRI (which is discouraged).\n\nHere the choice depends on the priorities (e.g., language neutrality vs. readability) and the intended users of the ontology.\n\n2. Define syntactic rules for local names\n\nIt is important to establish clear rules for the local name portion of IRIs (i.e., the part after the hash or last slash). Some widely adopted practices include:\n\n- Use only letters and digits (avoid special characters).\n\n- Classes: Use CamelCase (e.g., ElectricVehicle, AirQualitySensor).\n\n- Properties: Use mixedCase (e.g., hasMeasurement, measuresValue).\n\n- Individuals: Use consistent patterns (e.g., instance001, MadridCity), depending on the context and reuse needs.\n\n3. Keep names stable and meaningful\n\nTry to avoid using version numbers, project names, or temporal information in term names. It is recommended to use short, clear terms that reflect the concept being modeled. If possible, also try to ensure that the term is unique within the ontology."

Then, create an initial conceptual draft that includes the main concepts you aim to represent. This early modeling step helps identify which elements may benefit from reuse.\n\n2) Search for existing resources\n\nOnce you know the types of concepts you might want to reuse, search in dedicated platforms and sources:\n\n- Ontology portals and catalogues: These platforms aggregate and publish ontologies, often offering tools to support discovery and reuse. Some are general-purpose (e.g.,  <a href='https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov' target='_blank'>Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV)</a>.), while others are domain-specific (e.g., <a href='https://agroportal.lirmm.fr/' target='_blank'>AgroPortal</a> for agriculture).\n\n- Scientific articles: Many ontologies are accompanied by academic publications. Searching bibliographic databases like Scopus, Web of Science, or Semantic Scholar may lead to detailed documentation and background.\n\n- Project-specific websites: Some ontologies are developed within the scope of specific projects and published through their official websites to increase visibility.\n\nExample: <a href='https://bimerr.iot.linkeddata.es/' target='_blank'>BIMERR</a> ontologies.\n\n- Open repositories: General-purpose repositories such as Zenodo or <a href='https://github.com/' target='_blank'>GitHub</a> are also commonly used to publish ontology files and associated documentation.\n\n3) Define your selection criteria\n\nGiven the vast number of existing ontologies, it is essential to establish criteria for evaluating their suitability:\n\n- Does it align with the scope and requirements of your ontology?\n\n- How well does it cover the domain you are modeling?\n\n- Is the expressivity and implementation language compatible with your own?\n\n- Is it licensed under open or clearly defined reuse terms?\n\n- Is it actively maintained (e.g., issue tracking, multiple versions)?\n\n- Is it supported by comprehensive and accessible documentation?\n\nFinally, if the authors are interested in publishing a scientific paper or report about the development of the ontology, in line with Principle 3 – Documentation, it is important to keep track of: 1) Where did you search for ontologies to reused, 2) Which ones were evaluated, 3) and what are the elements you are going to reused."

This allows more control and stability, as your ontology is not automatically affected by changes in the source ontology.\n\n- It is important to document the source of the reused terms using the annotation property rdfs:isDefinedBy to indicate the version IRI of the original ontology. \n\nExample: \n\n@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .\n\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n\n@prefix ex: <https://w3id.org/example> . \n\n<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/SO_0000704>  rdf:type owl:Class ;\n\n                  rdfs:label \"Gene\"@en ;\n\n                  rdfs:isDefinedBy <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/so.owl> ."

RDF Schema (RDFS) extends RDF with basic schema capabilities (e.g., classes, subclasses, domains, and ranges). While not highly expressive, RDF(S) is widely supported and often sufficient for metadata,  and lightweight ontologies.\n\n- OWL (Web Ontology Language): Highly expressive and ideal for complex logic-based modeling and reasoning.\n\nIn addition, there is also the SKOS  (Simple Knowledge Organization System) language, designed to represent controlled vocabularies such as taxonomies and thesauri. It is ideal for simpler hierarchies where formal logic is not required.\n\nNote: In the biomedical domain, it is also common to use the OBO format. While not a formal ontology language, it is human-readable and commonly used by OBO Foundry ontologies. However, it has less expressivity than OWL.\n\nOWL and RDF-based ontologies can be serialized in various format:\n\n- Turtle (.ttl): A compact and human-readable syntax.\n\n- RDF/XML (.rdf): XML-based syntax. Less human-friendly, but still used by a wide range of systems. \n\n- JSON-LD (.jsonld): JSON-based syntax, ideal for web-based applications. \n\n- N-Triples / N-Quads: used for data dumps or high-performance processing.\n\nHowever, offering multiple of these serializations is always a good practice.\n\nThere are many tools that support the development of ontologies in different representation languages and export in various formats:\n\n-  <a href='https://protege.stanford.edu/' target='_blank'>Protégé</a>: The most widely used open-source ontology editor.

While there are many approaches under development, ontology owners can already follow a set of essential practices to define a basic strategy for monitoring and managing the evolution of their ontology over time:\n\n1. Monitoring the changes\n\nOntology owners should continuously monitor the evolution of the domain the ontology represents. This includes:\n\n- Tracking changes in scientific consensus, terminology, or standards.\n\n- Engaging with domain experts to detect new requirements or corrections.\n\n- Retrieve the users' feedback, and open issues from collaborative platforms such as <a href='https://github.com/' target='_blank'>GitHub</a> or mailing lists.\n\n2. Define a changes managing strategy\n\nA minimal strategy should include the types of changes that are expected and how to handle them. The most common changes normally are:\n\n- Obsoletion of terms: When a term becomes obsolete it is a good practice is to mark them as deprecated using the owl:deprecated \"true\" and provide replacement suggestions when possible.\n\n- Modification of terms (or axioms): Updating the labels, textual definitions, or properties.\n\n- Addition of new terms: Introduce new concepts or relationships as the scope and/or the requirements of the ontology change or expand.\n\n3. Document changes and decisions\n\nEvery change made to the ontology should be documented for transparency and traceability:\n\n- Include the reason for the change.\n\n- Keep a changelog file or detailed release notes to promote traceability (e.g., in CHANGELOG.md or <a href='https://github.com/' target='_blank'>GitHub</a> Releases).\n\n- Reference related issues, discussions, or requests when applicable.\n\nThe evolution processes should be aligned with the versioning policies and be properly communicated to users (see Principle 5 – Identifiers, R10.2 Users Communication, and R10.3 Versioning)."

The following practices support effective versioning management:\n\n1. Assign persistent version identifiers\n\nEach official version of the ontology should have a unique and stable IRI. It is recommended to adopt a versioning pattern (e.g., semantic versioning v1.0.0) and consistently apply it to all published versions (see Principle 5 - Identifiers).\n\n2. Maintain a changelog\n\nA CHANGELOG.md file or equivalent release notes should be maintained in the version control system (e.g., GitHub). This file should clearly record:\n\n- The date of each release\n\n- A summary of the changes \n\n- Contributors involved in the changes\n\n3. Preserve previous versions\n\nMake previous ontology versions accessible. Avoid deleting or overwriting old versions, as they may be still used by external systems. In addition, it is important that in the current version is mentioned the previous ontology IRI version (normally done using the annotation owl:priorVersion).\n\n4. Synchronize documentation and metadata\n\nThe documentation and the ontology metadata must reflect the current version and the changes. Remember to update:\n\n- The metadata using the annotations owl:versionIRI and owl:versionInfo\n\n- The diagrams, requirements, queries, and usage examples"
